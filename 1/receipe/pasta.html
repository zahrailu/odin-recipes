    <h2><strong>How to Make Pasta Step-By-Step</strong></h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat Alfredo sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>Place salmon in a baking dish. Mix the lemon juice and vinegar in a small bowl, and pour over the salmon. Season with basil and parsley.</p>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>Bake salmon 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until easily flaked with a fork. Remove from heat, and break into bite sized pieces.</p>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini, and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and place in a large bowl.</p>
      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>Gently toss the salmon, pasta, and Alfredo sauce together in the large bowl. Serve with the Parmesan cheese.</p>
